# Neural Networks Ahoy: Cutting-Edge Ship Classification for Maritime Mastery

Welcome to the **Neural Networks Ahoy** project! This repository showcases a cutting-edge approach to ship classification using neural networks, specifically designed to enhance maritime mastery through advanced machine learning techniques.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop and implement a state-of-the-art neural network model for classifying ships based on their images. The project leverages deep learning techniques to accurately identify ship types, improving maritime operations and safety.

## Features

- **Data Acquisition**: Collection and preprocessing of ship images for model training.
- **Model Development**: Implementation of various neural network architectures for ship classification.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Testing and validating the model's accuracy and performance.
- **Web Application**: Web Application Inplementing model
